	<h1>Welcome</h1>

	<h2>to my portfolio website</h2>

	It's been 5 years since my last update, wow! <br>
	My latest project I've been working on all summer is
	<a href="https://twitter.com/CatalogScanner" target=_blank>@CatalogScanner</a>.<br>
	It basically is a tool for extracing items you own in Animal Crossing: New Horizon<br>
	from 30s videos or screenshots you can record with your Nintendo Switch.<br>
	The code is open source <a href="https://github.com/CatalogScanner" target=_blank>on GitHub</a>
	and I bought a fun domanin for it too: <a href="https://ehsan.lol" target=_blank>ehsan.lol</a>

	This year, I spent a lot of time working on various projects related to Twitch. <br>
	I coded a few webapps which I bought a new domain for: <a href="http://twitch.center">http://twitch.center</a>.<br>
	I also worked on programming various chat bots and spent some time contributing <br>
	code to open source projects such as <a href="https://github.com/night/betterttv">BetterTTV</a>.

	I've been mostly working on my steam-related webapps this summer. <br>
	I also bought a domain for it (<a href="http://steam.tools">http://steam.tools</a>) and added many new apps. <br>
	Lastly, I have purchased the Oculus Rift DK2, so I will hopefully be making cool demos with that soon.

	Worked on another little game this summer, this time in WebGL (through ThreeJS).<br />
	It's <a href="/tjs/doubletwin/" target="_blank">a remake of Double Twin</a> (a minigame in Evoland), with controller and multiplayer support.<br />
	I've also coded a <a href="http://imankia.com" target="_blank">portfolio for my brother</a>
	and made some neat looking <a href="http://ph0xy.deviantart.com/gallery/38301623" target="_blank">fractal-like images</a> in Apophysis.<br />
	Lastly, I've also been working on a set of useful <a href="/steam/">Steam related WebApps</a> to automate various tasks.<br />

	Another year, another update! Reworked the AJAX loading to support bookmark/history.<br />
	I've also completely revamped my <a href="../cjs/" target="_blank">Canvas/JS</a> page. Other than that, I've also been experimenting<br />
	with <a href="../css3/" target="_blank">CSS3</a> and <a href="../hawkthorne/" target="_blank">HTML5 game development</a>. Looking forward to learning some <a href="http://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>.<br />

	Summer of 2011 is here and it's time to work on my portfolio again.<br />
	GoogleIO really inspired me and I've decided to replace all my header images with WebFonts.<br />
	I've also updated my <a class="portfolio" href="#portfolio">Portfolio</a> and added some new <a href="../wgl/" target="_blank">WebGL</a> work I've been doing lately.<br />
	Other than that, just some quick adjustments here and there to keep things pretty.<br />
	<div class="breakline">&ldquo; 11.07.2011 at 4:35 PM by Ehsan Kia &rdquo;</div>

	Revamped the site again this weekend, converting most of the headers to png.<br />
	I also made all the pages load with AJAX, added some transition effects, and<br />
	also added custom fonts from <a href="http://www.typekit.com" target="_blank">TypeKit</a> to my site. Quickly updated the portfolio, <br />
	and also added a Canvas/Javascript section to it, but you can see <a href="../cjs/" target="_blank">the full gallery here</a>.<br />
