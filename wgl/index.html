These WebGL Experiments have been made for Chrome and I can't guaranty that they will work on other browsers.

		</td>

		<td>
			This one takes some time to load. Loading progress can be tracked in the pages title. <br />
			If it takes too long to load, try making the window size smaller. <br />
			Move your mouse around the Mandelbrot set in the background to create different Julia sets on the ball. <br />
			You can also zoom in and out the ball with your mousewheel, or drag the ball to rotate it.
		</td>

	<tr>

			<a href=2.html><img style="margin:20px" src="../img/wgl/2_s.jpg" /></a>
		</td>

			You can move around with WASD and jump with space. Mouse button toggles mouse control over the camera. <br />
			Currently, there's no way for the browser to capture the mouse, so true FPS control cannot be replicated. <br />
			Here, I tried to recreate an FPS camera and as you may have noticed, it's highly inpsired by CS 1.6. <br />
			I might add boxes and various objects in the future. Textures are from the map de_dust.

	</tr>

	<tr>

		<td>
			<a href=4.html><img style="margin:20px" src="../img/wgl/4_s.jpg" /></a>
		</td>

		<td>
			This is yet another experiment inspired by
			<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EnrZMrNBQc">this Minecraft video</a>. <br />
			Number of cubes can be changed with U / I. Distance between cubes can be changed with J / K. <br />
			You can again move around with WASD and look around with the mouse. <br />
